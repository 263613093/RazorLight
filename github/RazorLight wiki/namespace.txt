There are 3 default namespaces you should not enter manually:

+ System;
+ System.Linq;
+ System.Collections.Generic;

As soon as you are using types from other namespaces, you must write those namespaces. 
You can include them with "using" statement at the top of your template

@using MyLibrary;

But what if you want to have some kind of global namespaces, which you want your every template to have?
ASP.NET MVC allows you to create a **ViewImports** file for that. So at the moment Razor parses your template - it also looking for ViewImports file on the same folder your view is located and on *Shared* folder.

RazorLight supports files / embedded resources / custom sources. As *ViewImports* file is only appropriate while using files, in order to add namespaces to your templates use **IEngineConfiguration** for that.

### Example

````CSharp
var config = EngineConfiguration.Default;
config.Namespaces.Add("MyLibrary.Models");

var engine = new EngineFactory.CreateEmbedded(typeof(SomeTypeInsideAssembly), config);
````

RazorLight uses ITemplate manager to resolve templates by the specified key. 

Key can be represented as 
* Relative path to the file
* Name of the emmedded resource inside assembly
* ID of the record in database

Keys are also used to set up a template **Layout**

````HTML
@model MyViewModel

@{
    Layout = "key_here";
}
````

Available template managers:
* ````FilesystemTemplateManager```` - Use this to resolve templates from the specified directory
* ````EmbeddedResourceTemplateManager```` - Use this to resolve templates from assembly embedded resources. 

You can write your own implementation to resolve a template from your source.
